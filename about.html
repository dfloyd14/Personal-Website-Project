      <h3>My Poker Journey</h3>
      
<p>I have played poker my whole life, but first started playing online poker at age 21 while I was a student at the University of Virginia. At UVA, I stayed very busy as a student-athlete on the wrestling team and an Army ROTC scholarship recipient, but once I began playing online poker that was my #1 passion. I started off playing NLH tournaments, but while serving in Korea in 2017 as an Air Defense Artillery Officer, I found a home game that featured PLO and I became hooked. For the next two years, I played poker almost every day, refining my skills and slowly improving until I finally broke out in 2020 jumping up stakes all the way to 25/50 on Pokerbros at one point and I finished the year winning $177k.</p>

<p>I continued playing while in the Army for the next three years, having another big year in 2021 winning $270k, but struggled to achieve similar results over the next two years while I dealt with the stress of being a Company Commander in the Army. Eventually, I decided to move on from the Army, and decided to return home to Washington D.C. to pursue an MBA at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business in Fall 2024. With more free time available during graduate school than during my military service, I significantly increased my poker volume and began to dedicate serious effort to studying and refining my poker skills. As a result, my online poker results took off, allowing me to achieve consistent success at 5 & 6 card PLO.</p>

<p>Now, leveraging my extensive experience, proven results, and passion for teaching, I've launched my poker coaching business to help aspiring players achieve their own poker goals. My coaching focuses on clear, actionable strategies to help you improve quickly and sustainably in PLO.</p>
